            named after the legendary king Ravana, which is connected to the famous Indian epic, the Ramayana. According to legend, it is said 
            that Ravana (who was the king<br> of Sri Lanka at the time) had kidnapped princess Sita, and had hidden her in the caves behind this waterfall,
            now simply known as the Ravana Ella Cave.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravana_Falls" target="blank" style="color:black;">To Know More Click Here</a>

        <p>Sigiriya or the mount of remembrance is a World Heritage Site and one of the most stunning
            places to see in Sri Lanka. This giant formation of rock rises out of nowhere towering over<br>
            everything in its vicinity. It is quite a climb to the top but once up there you will get to see a
            panoramic view of the nearby sights and the Sigiriya fort. The rock fortress is a slice of
            history<br> perched on a rock and is really worth a visit.

            Not much is heard and said about Polonnaruwa, but this ancient city is no less than the Petra
            of the south. A gem among Sri Lanka tourist<br> attractions, this ancient ruined city stands
            amidst its erstwhile sturdy columns and architecture. The best way to explore this ancient
            city is to hire a bike and zoom around the ruins.<br> The site is well maintained and is a telling
            example of Sri Lankas history and culture. Polonnaruwa can be easily accessed via Sigiriya.
            You can take a tuk-tuk or a bus from Sigiriya<br> Or you can take a bus from Dambulla to 
            Polonnaruwa.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigiriya" target="blank" style="color:black;">To Know More Click Here</a>
